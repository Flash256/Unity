The Ai button lets you play against a random ai.
The two player button lets you play against your friends or another opponent.
The replay button lets you play another round keeping track of the score.
The restart button lets you restart the game completely.

AI
After finishing my tic tac toe game I decided that I should set off to make an AI. After spending weeks and months on the AI i decided to make it random instead of it being able to learn. As i keep progressing my coding skills i look forward to being able to finish offthe ai.
